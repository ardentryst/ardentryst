"""
Conch.py, a music toolkit.
By Kris Schnee, borrowing heavily from Pygame's docs and examples.

License: Free software; use as you please. Credit appreciated.
Requirements: Just Python and Pygame. Put all sound and music files
in subdirectories called "sound" and "music".
Notes: These are easy functions for using music and sound in Python/Pygame,
just wrappers around Pygame's functions. The Jukebox class keeps track of a
set of loaded sound effects and paths for songs, with keys so you can just
call 'j.PlaySong("Battle Music")' to access an obscurely named song file
neatly stored in a subdirectory. So, to use this code you just LoadSong for
whatever songs you like, giving the filename and a nickname, then PlaySong
to play. Same for sound effects, though behind the scenes the sounds are
actually loaded once and kept in memory instead of just the paths.

Example:
j = Jukebox()
j.LoadSong("battle00.mid","Battle Music")
j.PlaySong("Battle Music")
j.StopMusic()
